Malone University - RSS Feed example
=========

This example uses the SimplePie RSS library. 

SimplePie is a very fast and easy-to-use class, written in PHP, that puts the
'simple' back into 'really simple syndication'.  Flexible enough to suit
beginners and veterans alike, SimplePie is focused on [speed, ease of use,
compatibility and standards compliance][what_is].

Install
-------
To install this example, clone the repository and install SimplePie via composer.

SimplePie Requirements
------------
* PHP 5.2.0 or newer
* libxml2 (certain 2.7.x releases are too buggy for words, and will crash)
* Either the iconv or mbstring extension
* cURL or fsockopen()
* PCRE support

If you're looking for PHP 4.x support, pull the "one-dot-two" branch, as that's
the last version to support PHP 4.x.
